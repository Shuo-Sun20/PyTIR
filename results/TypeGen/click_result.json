So the type is likely `Optional[str]` (or just `str` if `None` is not allowed). \n\nBut again, the answer based purely on the code (without assuming `click` conventions) is `None`. \n\nWhich answer would you prefer?  \n\nFor now, I'll leave it as `None`, but let me know if you'd like me to adjust based on context.  \n\nFinal answer: `None`.  \n\n(Apologies for the over-analysis; let me know if you'd prefer a more concise approach in the future!)"
